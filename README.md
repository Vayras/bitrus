Simple command-line interface written in Rust for managing Bitcoin Core (`bitcoind`) in **regtest mode** and interfacing with its **JSON-RPC API**.

This tool helps developers interact with a local Bitcoin node easilyâ€”fetching block hashes, inspecting block stats, and exploring regtest mode with both scripted and interactive modes.

---

## Features

- Starts and stops a local `bitcoind` instance in regtest mode
- Fetch latest, previous, and next block hashes
- View basic block statistics via `getblockstats`
- Interactive CLI mode and command-line argument support
- Built in Rust using `clap` and `bitcoincore-rpc` crates
- more Features are being added daily.
